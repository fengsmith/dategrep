=head1 NAME

dategrep - print lines matching ranges of dates

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dategrep --start "12:00" --end "12:15" syslog
  dategrep --end "12:15" --format "%b %d %H:%M:%S" syslog
  dategrep --last-minutes 5 syslog
  cat syslog | dategrep --end "12:15" -

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dategrep searches the named input files for lines matching a date range and prints them to stdout.

If dategrep works on a seekable file, it can do a binary search to find
the first and last line to print pretty efficiently. dategrep can also
read from stdin if one the filename arguments is just a hyphen, but in
this case it has to parse every single line which will be slower.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --start DATESPEC

Print all lines from DATESPEC inclusively. Defauls to Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.
See
L<VALID-DATE-FORMATS|https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Date-Manip/lib/Date/Manip/Date.pod#VALID-DATE-FORMATS>
for a list of possible formats for DATESPEC.

=item --end DATESPEC

Print all lines until DATESPEC exclusively. Default to the current time. See
L<VALID-DATE-FORMATS|https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Date-Manip/lib/Date/Manip/Date.pod#VALID-DATE-FORMATS>
for a l
ist of possible formats for DATESPEC.

=item --last-minutes MINUTES

Print all lines from MINUTES minutes ago until the beginning of the current
minute. So if we have 19:25:43 and MINUTES is five, dategrep will print all
lines from 19:20:00 to 19:24:59.

=item --format

When this paramenter is missing, dategrep tries to match multiple formats and
use the first one that matches. If your format is not parsable by dategrep, you
can supply your own format based on the sequences listed unter L<PRINTF
DIRECTIVES|https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Date-Manip/lib/Date/Manip/Date.pod#PRINTF-DIRECTIVES>.
See the SYNOPSIS for an example.

=head1 INSTALLATION

It is possible to install this script via perl normal install routines. 

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build install

Or you can just copy the script somewhere in your path and install its only
dependency Date::Manip. In Debian you just need the following:

  apt-get install libdate-manip-perl

=head1 LIMITATION

At the moment dategrep will die as soon as it finds a line that is not parsable.
In a future version this will be configurable.
