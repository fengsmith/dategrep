 [frontend changes]
 - better handling of multiline logs

   Before this release lines with no date were printed if the last
   line with a date was still in range. But when using --sort order
   --interleave this would lead to strange sorting. dategrep now reads
   a multiline log as single entry and prints it together.

 - added --version
 - smaller standalone scripts by striping them
 - updated documention (thanks szepeviktor!)

 [internal changes]

 - switched to Dist::Zilla
 - moved unmaintained emacs mode to contrib
