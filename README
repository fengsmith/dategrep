App::dategrep

dategrep searches the named input files for lines matching a date range
and prints them to stdout.

If dategrep works on a seekable file, it can do a binary search to find
the first and last line to print pretty efficiently. dategrep can also
read from stdin and compressed files, but it has to parse every single
line until the end of the range for those.

INSTALLATION

It is possible to install this script via perl normal install routines. 

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build install

Or you can use one of the two prebuild versions, which already include all or
same of dategreps dependencies. Which to choose mainly depends on how hard it
is for you to install Date::Manip. The small version is just 22.3KB big and
includes all libraries except Date::Manip. The big one packs everything in a
nice, neat package for you, but will cost you almost 10MB of disk space. Both
are always included in the L<latest
release|https://github.com/mdom/dategrep/releases/latest>.

So, to install the big version you could just type:

  wget https://github.com/mdom/dategrep/releases/download/$release/dategrep-standalone-big
  cp dategrep-standalone-big.pl ~/bin/dategrep
  chmod +x ~/bin/dategrep

And for the small one (with the apt-get for Debian):

  wget https://github.com/mdom/dategrep/releases/download/$release/dategrep-standalone-small
  cp dategrep-standalone-small.pl ~/bin/dategrep
  chmod +x ~/bin/dategrep
  apt-get install libdate-manip-perl
